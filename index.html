      Still searching for that once-in-a-lifetime culinary experience? Feel a need to reconnect to your roots and root vegetables? How about your heirloom (tomatoes)? You don’t need to travel far—request your free (!) home dinner party before this once-in-a-digital-fringe experience is going once, going twice, gone as chicken soup with rice. Simply open your hearts, homes, and pantry to us, and in return for your hospitality, Chez Vous will bring a skeleton video production crew into your very kitchen to cook up a storm, regale you with some home-brewed theatre, and livestream the entire proceeding to Twitch.

      Rated one of America’s most recently popular shows among the 18-84 demographic, Chez Vous brings the show to vous through an ongoing series of introspective, interactive, in-your-kitchen programming. Hot off the studio circuit and into some fresh cilantro, this show dares to ask the question, “So what extra food do you have lying around?”
